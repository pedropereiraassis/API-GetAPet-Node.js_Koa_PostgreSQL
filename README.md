# API-GetAPet-Node.js_Koa_PostgreSQL
This API does the exact same thing of my other repository [API-GetAPet-Node.js_Express_MongoDB](https://github.com/pedropereiraassis/API-GetAPet-Node.js_Express_MongoDB)
But this one I adapted for Koa, changing DB to PostgreSQL and using Docker.

# Usage
Run the following command to install necessary dependencies
```
npm install
```

Then, make sure Docker is running and run the command
```
docker-compose up
```

And now you can test all the routes.
